#example one on for loop

# for x in salaryList:
#     print(x * "a")

#example two on for loop
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
# # for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

#example three on for loop
# data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# total = 0
# for num in data:
#     total += num
#     average = total / len(data)
#     print("Average:", average)

#example four on for loop


# for y in range(5):
# 		x = y + 1
# 		print("*" * x )
